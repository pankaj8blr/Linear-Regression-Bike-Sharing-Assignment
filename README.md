## General Information
BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider, is looking to predict the demand for shared bikes after the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to develop a multiple linear regression model to understand which factors influence bike demand and to provide actionable insights for business planning. This project uses historical data, including weather conditions, seasonal factors, and user behaviors, to predict the daily bike rental counts..

**Approach:**
**1. Data Exploration:** 
(i). Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
(ii). Checked for missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables.
**2. Data Preparation:** 
(i). Converted categorical variables (e.g., season, weathersit) into dummy variables.
(ii). Applied feature scaling to ensure numeric variables are on the same scale.
**3. Model Building:**
(i).Built a multiple linear regression model with cnt (total bike rentals) as the target variable.
(ii).Iteratively refined the model by removing features with high p-values and multicollinearity (using VIF).
**4. Model Evaluation:**
(i).Assessed performance using metrics like R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and residual analysis.
(ii).Evaluated the model on test data to ensure generalizability.
**5. Residual Analysis:**
(i).Checked residuals to verify linear regression assumptions (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity).

## Key Findings
- Variables such as yr, temp, season, and weathersit were significant predictors of bike demand.
- Removing highly collinear or insignificant variables improved model interpretability without significantly reducing predictive power.
- R-squared on the test set was high, indicating a good fit of the model to unseen data.

## Conclusion
The regression model successfully identifies the key factors influencing bike demand. Insights from this model can help BoomBikes adjust its business strategies and prepare for increased demand in specific seasons and weather conditions. The results show that variables like temperature and year-over-year trends play a critical role in predicting demand.
